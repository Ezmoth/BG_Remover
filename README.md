# Program I made for my co-worker and myself to speed up process of uploading pictures to the company's database. Previous process requaired to upload photos to the website, uploading them back, cutting the suffix from file name that website added, cropping the picture and adding (if necessary) numbers for parts on bottom of the picture. All of this had to be done manually and one by one (to some extent obviously).
#
# This program speed up our process and only part that still needs to be done manually and on one by one basis is uploading pictures to server.
#
# NOTE: For now the files in use are Parts.py (main script) and Test_Parts.py (contains functions for adding the parts numbers). The program adds numbers to the bottom of the pictures by looking at how file name ends for example if it ends on p2 that indicates 2 parts article, p3 means 3 part article. this works up to 6 parts as I simply don't need more.
